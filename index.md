date: October 7-11 2024

The OTP developers are meeting in October in Berlin to discuss technical topics and to socialise. 
Even though this mini-conference is focussed on technical details everybody is welcome and just listening in is totally fine.

Some other groups, like product owners, will also meet in the same work space.
